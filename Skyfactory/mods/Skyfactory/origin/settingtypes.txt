# If enabled (true by default), the Origin mod automatically sets the map
# generator to singlenode and ignores the player-selected map generator in
# order to create an nearly empty world with the Origin near the center.
# Disabling this setting will make this mod place the Origin without changing
# the map generator, so it could appear in the v6 map generator, for example.
