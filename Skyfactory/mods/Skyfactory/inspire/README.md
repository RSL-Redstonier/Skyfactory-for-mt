# inspire

Inspire is a little mod that gives players a craft item reward for exploring the world and building things. The reward is an "inspiration", which can be used to upgrade and duplicate materials, and make other things. The inspirations are not supposed to be rare or particularly valuable -- they just exist to encourage people.

Whenever a chunk is generated by the mapgen, anyone within a given radius (500 blocks by default) will be awarded a certain number of points. After they collect enough, an inspiration is added to their inventory.

Building is just defined as placing blocks. More decorative blocks have higher point rewards. It's quite easy to game the system by repeatedly placing and digging the same blocks, or just dumping loads of dirt everywhere. I'm not all that concerned about making it more particular.

This is a work in progress.
